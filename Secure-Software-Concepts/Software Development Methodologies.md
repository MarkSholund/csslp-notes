# Software Development Methodologies

## Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL)
- add process checks to development process to include necessary security elements

### Principles
- SMART - Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, Time bound

### Security vs Quality
- quality = fitness for use or absence of defects
- high quality != secure but low quality with lots of defects will have security issues from basic mistakes

### Security Features != Secure Software
- encryption, authentication, and other security features can improve usability
- secure software development is different: ensure all elements of software operate securely
- adding security features may make software more marketable but secure software means it does what it was designed to do and only what it was designed to do
