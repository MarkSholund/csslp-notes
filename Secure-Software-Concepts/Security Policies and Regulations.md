# Security Policies and Regulations

**All hazards**: senior management is responsible for security, compliance, all exercises in risk management

## FISMA
###### Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002
- Requires each federal agency to implement a security program
- NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) developed guidelines
- Risk Management Framework (RMF) was published by NIST
  - Initial framework included:
    - Inventory of systems
    - Categorize information and systems according to risk level
    - security controls
    - Certification/accreditation of systems (risk assessment and security plans)
    - Training
- Information Security Automation Program
- Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)

NIST six steps for a RMF:
1. Categorize systems
2. Select security controls
3. Implement controls
4. Assess Controls
5. Authorize information systems
6. Monitor controls

## Sarbanes-Oxley
- financial accounting information systems must have control over integrity

## Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act / Financial Modernization Act of 1999 (GLBA)
- Protect PFI (personal financial information)
  - act specifies rules for collection, processing, storage, and disposal of PFI

Primary rules:
1. Financial Privacy Rule - collection and disclosure of PFI
2. Safeguards Rule - applies to financial institutions - covers design, implementation, and maintenance of safeguards to protect PFI
3. Pretexting Protections Rule - address pretexting (falsely pretending) to obtain PFI

## HIPAA and HITECH
- HIPAA - (Healthcare Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) 
  - Protect PHI (personal health information)
- HITECH - (Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act)
  - enhance privacy of electronic PHI records

## Payment Card Industry (PCI)
Industry group established to secure cardholder data

### Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
Industry group members that accept and process bank cards are required to protect cardholder data

### Payment Application Data Security Standard (PA DSS)
Standard to validated that a payment application is compliant with PCI DSS

### PIN Transaction Security (PTS)
Applies to PIN Entry Devices (PEDs)

## Legal Issues

### Intellectual Property

1. Patents
  - Exclusive right for a specified time
  - protect rights in exchange for disclosure of invention
  - Varies by country but in the US, invention must be new, useful, and nonobvious
  - Prevent others from using invention
  - Patent must be applied for prior to disclosure
  - challenging and expensive
2. Copyrights
  - Protection of an idea or information for a specified time
  - right to be credited, who may adapt, who may perform, who may financially benefit, etc
  - governed internationally by Berne Convention
  - straightforward and affordable
3. Trademarks
  - recognizable quality of product/firm
  - used to build brand association
  - can be common-law or registered - registered provides more legal protection and recovery
  - managed internationally through World Intellectual Property Organization
4. Trade Secrets
  - best time-based protection
  - protected by many laws as long as company makes a reasonable attempt to keep it secret
  - if secret is independently discovered (e.g. recipe), then secret holder has no recourse
  - US Digital Millenium Copyright Act prohibits reverse-engineering of security safeguards
5. Warranty
  - hardware often has a warranty to perform at the specified level
  - software does not and is generally sold as is

## Privacy
To obtain certain goods, users must consent to share certain information

One main issue with privacy is data disposition

### Privacy Policy
Internal privacy policy details the firm's responsibilities to protect information

External privacy policy, or privacy disclosure statement, informs customers how data is protected, used, and disposed of

In financial sector, Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act mandates firms clearly state how information is shared

### PII

### PHI (Personal Health Information / Protected Health Information)
Highly valued by cybercriminals 

### Breach notifications
