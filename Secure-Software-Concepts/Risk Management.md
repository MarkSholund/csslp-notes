# Risk Management
###### assess the impact if an adverse event were to happen decide what could be done to control that impact as deemed necessary

Well formed risk statement includes:
1. asset
2. threat
3. vulnerability
4. mitigation
5. impact
6. probability

## Risk
Systematic risk
- fire, theft, software bugs - mitigated through diversification
- predictable under stable circumstances
Unsystematic risk
- recession, epidemics, protocol design errors
- come from sources that are difficult to predict

### Business risk
- operation of a business as a business

Examples:
- Treasury management (financial risk)
  - holdings in bonds, futures, currencies, etc
- Revenue management
- Contract management
- Fraud
  - deliberate deception
- Regulatory 
- Business continuity
- Technology

### Technology risk
- technology used in development process as well as software functionality

Examples:
- Security - protective attributes
- Privacy - attributes that define access/sharing
- Project risk management
- Change management

### Risk controls
best method for managing risk

Understanding environment and applying controls should be owned by development team

Three classes:
1. Administrative
2. Technical
3. Physical


#### Preventative
- primary control
- proactive
- best mitigation
- **goal**: stop attack

Examples:
- separation of duties
- adequate documentation
- physical control over assets
- authorization mechanisms

#### Detective
- reactive
- **goal**: detect presence of attack

Examples:
- logs
- audits
- inventories

#### Corrective
- after a vulnerability is exploited
- **goal**: reduce total impact

#### Compensating
- when primary controls fail
- reactive
- defense in depth

Example: separation of duties is a preventitve control to prevent fraud, financial review of reports is an after the fact compensating control

#### Controls framework
- managing risk as part of a complete system

## Qualitative
###### Subjectively determine impact of an event - involves experts and group consensus 
Two aspects: impact and probability

### Qualitative matrix

## Quantitative
###### Objectively determine impact of an event - involves use of metrics and models


# Security Policies and Regulations

# Software Development Methodologies
