- authorization to operate
  - management decision given by senior official to authorize operation of an information system and explicitly accept risk
- linker (software)
  - combines one or more files (often generated by compiler) into a single executable

  - buffer: reference to space in memory for moving data

## TODO

- security controls
- recovery time objective
- risk response
- real user monitoring vs synthetic monitoring
- software qualification planning
- cumulative failure profile
- Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification (CAPEC) vs Attack pattern
- compiler switches
