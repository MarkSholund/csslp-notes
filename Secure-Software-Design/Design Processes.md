# Design Processes

## Attack Surface Evaluation
- includes code, input fields, protocols, interfaces, files, and services
- higher attack surface != bad code, it's just a measure of how many things can be attacked
- turning off unused/unneeded features will minimize attack surface

### Attack Surface Management
