# Secure Software Installation and Deployment

## Installation

- SDLC is broken into two phases: development and sustainment
- Sustainment includes: installation, deployment, operations, maintenance

### Installation V&V

- Use MITRE's Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) to evaluate code

### Planning for Operational Use

#### Bootstrapping

- set of ops that properly launch function and ensure continuing correctness
- aka booting - e.g. PC power on self-test (POST)
  - integrity is mandatory
- implement error detection and correction
