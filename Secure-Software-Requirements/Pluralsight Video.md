# Why do software projects fail?

## Failures
- Late delivery
- over budget 
- fails to meet user expectations 

## Causes
- Requirements were wrong, incomplete, or changed during project
- new unproven technology
- unrealistic user expectations (e.g. budget too low)
- lack of experienced staff

# How to make the project successful?
- Build security in the project
- start early
- gather security AND functional requirements

# Traditional SDLC
1. Describe functional requirements
2. Define -> Design -> Develop -> Deploy
3. Deliver a working product

Security wasn't involved until the end, difficult to convince at this step

# Shift in Focus
- Discover security requirements early
- Weave security into each step of the process
- security benchmarking

# Purpose of security is to support business operations!

# Failure of requirements gathering
- not talking to the right people
- not understanding business problems
- not understanding technology 

# Requirements
- Function vs cost
- laws, regulations, compliance
